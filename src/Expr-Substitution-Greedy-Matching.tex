THIS MATCHING IS GREEDY AND SHOULD REALLY BE DEFERRED

We have a pattern, where w.l.o.g., we have the standard variables first
($u_1,\ldots,u_k$) and the list-variables last ($ v\$_1,\ldots,v\$_\ell$),
and the expressions substituting for the list-variables are themselves
list variables ($f\$_1,\ldots,f\$_\ell$):
$$
 [ e_1,\ldots,e_k , f\$_1,\ldots,f\$_\ell
 /
   u_1,\ldots,u_k ,  v\$_1,\ldots,v\$_\ell ]
 , \quad k+\ell \geq 1
$$
and test:
$$
 [ g_1,\ldots,g_m , h\$_1,\ldots,h\$_n
 /
   a_1,\ldots,a_m ,  b\$_1,\ldots,b\$_n ]
 , \quad m+n \geq 1
$$
The $e_i$ and $g_i$ are expressions,
while all the others are variables.
Matching must take into account:
\begin{itemize}
  \item First of all, $m \geq k$, or no match is possible.
  \item We match the $e_i$ and $u_i$
        against the first $k$ of the $g_i$ and $a_i$.
        This may fail with binding conflicts.
        The resulting bindings are of the form:
        $$
          \begin{array}{ccc}
             e_i & \ddagger & g_i
          \\ u_j & \mapsto & a_j
          \end{array}
        $$
  \item We are then left with pattern:
        $$
        [  f\$_1,\ldots,f\$_\ell
        /
         \qsep  v\$_1,\ldots,v\$_\ell ]
        $$
        and test:
        $$
         [ g_{k+1},\ldots,g_m , h\$_1,\ldots,h\$_n
         /
         a_{k+1},\ldots,a_m \qsep  b\$_1,\ldots,b\$_n ]
         , \quad m+n \geq 1
        $$
        If $\ell=0$ and $m+n > 0$ we fail,
        otherwise we simply return the additional bindings ($\ell\geq 2$):
        $$
         \begin{array}{l@{\mapsto}l}
            f\$_1 & g_{k+1},\ldots,g_m
         \\ f\$_2 & h\$_1,\ldots,h\$_n
         \\ f\$_i & \nil, i > 2
         \\ v\$_1 & a_{k+1},\ldots,a_m
         \\ v\$_2 & b\$_1,\ldots,b\$_n
         \\ v\$_i & \nil, i > 2
         \end{array}
        $$
        or (if $\ell =1$):
        $$
         \begin{array}{l@{\mapsto}l}
            f\$_1 & g_{k+1},\ldots,g_m ,  h\$_1,\ldots,h\$_n
         \\ v\$_1 & a_{k+1},\ldots,a_m \qsep  b\$_1,\ldots,b\$_n
         \end{array}
        $$
\end{itemize}
The bindings for $e_i$ are normal expression match bindings,
those for $u_i$ are \texttt{Var} expression variant
and for $v\$_k$ we have standard \texttt{QVar} bindings.
The bindings for the $f\$$ are in general a pair of lists,
one of expressions, the other of variables.
We store these two lists (for now) in a nested  \texttt{\texttt{Prod}/\texttt{Seq}} expression variant
(even if we have singleton or null lists).
