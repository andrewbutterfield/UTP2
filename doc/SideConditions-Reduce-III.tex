We reduce each set-condition,
discarding any that evaluate to true,
and keeping those that we cannot reduce to ground form,
but returning an overall result of nothing
if any ground test reduces to false,
as the set-condition list is conjunctive.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \lefteqn{reduce_{MS}\left(\bigwedge\setof{m_1,\ldots,m_n}\right)}
\\&=&
  \left\{\begin{array}{l@{,~~}l}
    \False & reduce_M(m_i) \equiv \False, \textbf{ any } i \\
    \True & reduce_M(m_i) \equiv \True, \textbf{ all } i \\
    \bigwedge\setof{reduce_M(m_1),\ldots,reduce_M(m_n)} & \textbf{otherwise}
  \end{array}\right.
\end{eqnarray*} 
Any $reduce_M(m_i) \equiv \True$ are dropped.
