\textbf{Translate Law Side-Condition (In-Context)}\\ % outer list
Using the revised \texttt{qtrie} value,
we now translate the side-condition properly,
using the bindings and a context side-condition (goal)
to get a law side-condition in terms of goal variables.
If the context side-condition is false,
we return \texttt{SCtrue} because basically all bets are off!

What is not addresses properly here at present is what happens
when a fresh list-variable maps to more that one target variable.
