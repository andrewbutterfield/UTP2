
We present here the basic structural matching rules

\MRSTRUCT

We have two versions of null-quantifier matching:
\begin{description}
  \item[\MRNullQuantZN] allows all list-variables in a quantifier
   to match empty lists,
   which results in a law like
   \[(\exists \lst x @ P) = \lnot(\forall \lst x @ \lnot P)\]
   being able to match
   \[ P = \lnot\lnot P, \qquad \textrm{with } \lst x \mapsto \nil \]
  \item[\MRNullQuantON] requires at least one list-variable in a quantifer
   to match a non-empty list, so preventing the above match.
\end{description}
Currently we adopt \MRNullQuantZN, with surprising (but so far, sound) results.
Using \MRNullQuantON\ might be preferable to avoid confusion though.
This should probably be something that can be toggled.
