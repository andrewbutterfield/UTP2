These rules are expressed with variables in \emph{abstract} form.

We use notation $(r,\setof{d_1,d_2})$
to mean either $(r,d_1)$ or $r,d_2$.
In the rules antecedents it means any variable of the above forms,
and in the consequents it refers to the one being matched.

We use $*$ to mean $\setof{Pre,Post,Subscript}$,
and $PP$ to mean $\setof{Pre,Post,PrePost}$.
