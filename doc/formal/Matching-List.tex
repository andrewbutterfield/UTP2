
We first look at matching single list-variable patterns.
We deal with general list-variables ($\lst x$) first,
then look at the reserved variables $Obs$ and $Mdl$,
noting that the rules for $Scr$ are ``complementary'' to those for $Mdl$.

We then consider the special case of 2-place predicates
where both predicate ``places'' are occupied by a single list-variable.
