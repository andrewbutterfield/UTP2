The approach is to lift range elements of $vt : VT$
by turning variable strings into \texttt{Tvar}s,
and treating the resulting lists as equivalence-sets.
The domain elements of $tt :TT$ are lifted to \texttt{Tvar}s,
merged with their domains lists to give further equivalence sets.

We need to extract out
any equivalences implied but not already explicit
in existing lists,
e.g.: equivalence set $\setof{t_1,t_2^*,t_3^*}$
not only asserts that $t_1$ is the same as both $t_2^*$
and $t_3^*$, but also implies that $t_2 = t_3$,
so inducing the set $\setof{t_2,t_3}$.
We do this by proceeding down an ordered type-list,
skipping Tvars until the first constructor, if any, is found.
We then match successive entries, and look for bindings
of the form \texttt{Tvar} $\mapsto$ \texttt{TVar} and use these to generate
2-element equivalence sets.
