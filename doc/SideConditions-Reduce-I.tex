Given a free-variable set-expression,
we will want to reduce it to towards ground form,
using hints gleaned from side-conditions.
In particular we want to make explicit the
connection between $\isFresh x$ and $P \DISJ \setof x$
for all predicate meta-variables $P$.

At the top-level, we simply reduce set-conditions,
and discard any that evaluate to empty.
\begin{eqnarray*}
  reduce_S\left(\bigcup\setof{c_1,\ldots,c_n}\right)
  &=&
  \bigcup\left\{reduce_C(c_1), \ldots, reduce_C(c_n)\right\}
\end{eqnarray*}
