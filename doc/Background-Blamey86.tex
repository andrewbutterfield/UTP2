\subsection{Partial Logic (Blamey 1986)}
Based on \cite{Blamey86}

This material is largely philosophical in nature,
quite dense, and uses technical terms (e.g. ``singular condition'')
that are unfamiliar.
The emphasis is largely on model-theoretic aspects.

However in sections 1 and 6, details of a partial logic
are given, including some unusual operators.
