\section{What is \UTP2?}

\UTP2 is a theorem-proving assistant for Hoare and He's Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP) \cite{UTP-book}.
It was developed as a tool to support foundational work in the UTP,
that is, the development of UTP theories.
A user-friendly graphical user-interface (GUI)
has been designed into the tool from the start.
