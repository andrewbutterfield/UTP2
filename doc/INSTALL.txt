INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Binary install for Windows

1. Unpack ZIP archive to were you want application to live.

2. Run executable - it should set-up required directories and
   files.

 Note: every time you start the application on Windows Vista
 or later operating systems, you get an error about comctl32.dll being
 missing - just dismiss the error message and continue.

 Some features to do with fonts in the Appearance menu do not work.
 This "feature" should disappear when I can manage to build on a more recent
 version of wxHaskell/Haskell.
