\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}

There has been a lot of work encoding UTP
in ProofPower/HOL\cite{conf/utp/OliveiraCW06,conf/utp/ZC08,journal/facs/ocw13},
or Isabelle/HOL \cite{conf/utp/FeliachiGW10,conf/vstte/FeliachiGW12,journal/scp/zc12a}.
In \cite{conf/utp/ZhuLHQ12} Maude is used to link the operational
and algebraic semantics of VHDL.

These other approaches to encoding UTP theories require
the reasoning techniques to be adapted to the style best suited
for the theorem provers, typically being based on some concept of proof tactics
and scripts. GUI support is typically limited to integrated text editor support.

The ISAR proof language of Isabelle/HOL\cite{rep:ppIHOL:13}
provides perhaps the closest approximation to the UTP equational reasoning style.
The main emphasis is on proofs as chains of implications,
so its more ``inequational'' in nature.
