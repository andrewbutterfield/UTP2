Record Forced Single Matches \textbf{No Longer Used}\\
  Having inverted the tables \texttt{sngltab} and \texttt{multtab}
  to get two tables with entries of the form:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    a_i &\mapsto& \setof{\ldots x \ldots; \ldots xs \ldots}
  \\ as_j &\mapsto& \setof{; \ldots xs \ldots}
  \end{eqnarray*}
  We then proceed through the inverted \texttt{sngltab} table,
  processing as follows:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item if we have $a_i \mapsto \emptyset$ we FAIL.
    \item If we have $a_i \mapsto \setof{x_j}$,
      we enter $x_j \mapsto a_i$ into the result bindings
      (which may fail),
      and then remove this entry
      and $x_j$ from all the range sets of both inverted
      tables.
    \item
      If we have $a_i \mapsto \setof{xs_k}$,
      we enter $xs_k \mapsto a_i$ into the result bindings
      (which will not fail),
      and then remove this entry.
    \item otherwise we skip this entry and move on.
  \end{itemize}
  Every time these tables change we repeat until a
  pass results in no change.
  We are then left with goal variables that still have
  multiple possible bindings.
