\UTP2\ is a theorem prover developed to support the Unifying Theories
of Programming (UTP) framework.
Its primary design goal was to support the higher-order logic,
alphabets, equational reasoning and ``programs as predicates'' style
that is prevalent in much of the UTP literature,
from the seminal work by Hoare \& He onwards.
In this paper we focus on the matching engine that is the
heart of the theorem prover.
Designed to support the equational reaosning style of UTP,
as well as offering the flexibility of notation that is a hallmark
of much published UTP work, the law-matching process
involves structural matching merged with a blend of inference
systems that reason about types, side-conditions, and UTP's
own particular instance of the frame problem,
with regard to both alphabets and quantifier variable lists.
