\textbf{Rule out Expression Matches}\\
 There may already be matches in \texttt{ebind} from law (single-)variables
 to goal \texttt{Var}s --- these should be removed from \texttt{qvms}
 and added into \texttt{qbind}.
 This can fail if there is any conflict with pre-existing
 \texttt{qbind} entries,
 and so serves as an early way to weed out matches that must eventually fail.
