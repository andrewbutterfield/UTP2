\section{Syntax Changes}\label{sec:syntax:change}

Note: there have been some key notation changes in the area
of variable naming conventions, and the structure of quantifier and substitution.
The key changes from \cite{conf/utp/Butterfield12} are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    The distinction between Standard and List variables was originally done
    positionally in a quantifier list, with the `$\qsep$` character separating the
    lists. What was
    $ \forall x,y\qsep zs @ P $
    now becomes
    $ \forall x,y,\lst z @ P $.
    Annotating list variables directly turns out to be much simpler that relying
    on which of two sub-lists they are found, and avoids dangerously confusing
    possibilities to overload one variable name, \emph{e.g.:}
    $ \forall x \qsep x @ P$, \emph{c.f:} $\forall x,\lst x @ P$.
  \item
    We use much shorter names for the reserved list-variables,
    so $Obs$ becomes
    $\OBS$, for example.
    Note that reserved list-variables do not have trailing $\lst{}$
    (the postfix is superfluous here).
\end{itemize}
