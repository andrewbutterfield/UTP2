\textbf{Find all possible Substitution Matches (II)}\\
  Argument \texttt{subm} is a pair of the form:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
   (~(a_1,f_1),\ldots,(a_n,f_n), (\lst a_1,\lst f_1),\ldots,(\lst a_m,\lst f_m)
   &,&
     (x_1,e_1),\ldots,(x_k,e_k), (\lst x_1,\lst e_1),\ldots,(\lst x_\ell,\lst e_\ell)~)
  \\ \mbox{test}  &,& \mbox{pattern}, \quad n \geq k \land ((n \neq k \lor m > 0) \implies \ell > 0)
  \end{eqnarray*}
If $k=0$ we are done, with no changes,
otherwise we try matching every single-pattern against every single-test.
In effect, we get a 2-dim grid showing which
tests and pattern match:
$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|}
    & af_1 & \ldots & af_n
\\\hline
 xe_1 &  \beta_{11}  & \ldots   & \beta_{1n}
\\\hline
 \vdots & \vdots   & \ddots   & \vdots
\\\hline
 xe_k &  \beta_{k1}  &  \ldots  & \beta_{kn}
\\\hline
\end{array}
,\qquad n \geq k
$$
where $\beta_{ij}$ can be a valid binding, or a failure indicator.
If any row has only failure indicators,
then the entire match fails.
It is clear we construct this table by matching each standard
pattern in turn against all standard tests, failing immediately
if a pattern fails to match.

Otherwise, we know a solution is possible,
so we then try to construct a list of valid bindings where every pattern
occurs in exactly one binding, and every test in at most one.

If successful, we return the bindings,
and, as we have selected a matching of every $(x_i,e_i)$
  against an equal number of $(a_j,f_j)$,
  we are left us with the
  following situation (w.l.o.g.) still to be resolved:
  \begin{eqnarray*}
   (~(a_{k+1},f_{k+1}),\ldots,(a_n,f_n), (\lst a_1,\lst f_1),\ldots,(\lst a_m\lst f_m)
   &,&
     (\lst x_1,\lst e_1),\ldots,(\lst x_\ell,\lst e_\ell)~)
  \\ \mbox{test}  &,& \mbox{pattern}, \quad n \geq k \land ((n \neq k \lor m > 0) \implies \ell > 0)
  \end{eqnarray*}
  We return this ``leftover'' pair.
