\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We have given motivation for, and presented, \STHN,
a theorem-proving assistant for UTP.
The current state of the tool is still experimental,
with considerable scope for enhancement and improvement,
but is already a useful tool for experienced\footnote{Not too trusting!}
developers of UTP foundations.

Apart from the obvious need for comprehensive library of useful theorems
from general logic, arithmetic, set, list and map theory,
there are still a few foundational issues that need to be resolved.
The current limitation to fixed alphabets is too restrictive,
but we have a plan, using special meta-variables known to the pattern matcher,
to be able to describe generic laws that cross a number of theories:
the gold standard here would be a definition of sequential composition\
\begin{center}
$
  P ; Q
  ~~\defs~~
  \exists OBS_m @ P[OBS_m/OBS'] \land Q[OBS_m/OBS],
   \quad OBS_m \mbox{ fresh}
$
\end{center}
that works in any theory whose observations are homogenous
(meta variables $OBS_m$, $OBS'$ and $OBS$ would need special pattern matching
and binding treatment).
The treatment of undefinedness in a way that limits its impact on general proving
is still under exploration, and we are exploring various ideas in this area
\cite{wkshp/mpf/arthan:96}.
Given the existing work on UTP and Circus using Proofpower-Z,
we also hope to explore the ability to take the GUI front-end of \STHN,
and couple it to ProofPower-Z as a backend, given some appropriate transformation
of how proofs and theorems are presented.
