		 and proof plan presentation in natural language, and an

		 L\Omega UI is realized in an agent-based client-server
		 architecture and implemented in the concurrent
		 constraint programming language Oz. 1. Introduction The
		 effective use of an interactive theorem proving system
		 depends not least on the capabilities of its user
		 interface. A major problem is the adequate access to
		 the overwhelming amount of information manipulated by
		 these systems. This requires structure-oriented
