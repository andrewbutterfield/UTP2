We describe a prototype theorem prover, \UTP2, developed to match the style
of hand-written proof work in the Unifying Theories of Programming semantical
framework. This is based on alphabetised predicates in a 2nd-order logic,
with a strong emphasis on equational reasoning.
We present here an overview of the user-interface of this prover,
which was developed from the outset using a point-and-click approach.
We contrast this with the command-line paradigm that continues to dominate
the mainstream theorem provers,
and raises the question: can we have the best of both worlds?
