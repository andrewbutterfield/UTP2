\section{Introduction}

\STHN\footnote{Pronounced ``See-heen''.}
is an experimental proof assistant for the logic used in UTP,
supporting a notion of UTP theory, an intuitive prover interface
that supports the equational reasoning style that is prevalent in \cite{UTP-book}
and much other UTP-related literature,
with facilities for the user to define the syntax and semantics
of their own language constructs.
The tool consists of a core equational prover we have developed
in concert with a closely-coupled GUI interface.
At present its focus is on supporting foundational work in developing UTP,
rather than the application of the theory to a ``real-world'' design problem.


\subsection{Motivation}

We are doing foundational work in the UTP \cite{UTP-book},
which requires formal reasoning with not only predicates,
but also predicate transformers: $\RR3(P)$ $\defs$ $\Skip \cond{wait} P$
and predicates over predicates: $P = \RR3(P)$.
We also need to use recursion at the predicate level:
$ P \defs \mu Q \bullet F(Q)$,
as well as partially-defined expressions:
$s \le s \cat (tr'-tr) \equiv  tr \le tr'$.
The logic being used is therefore semi-classical
(two-valued logic, but expressions may be undefined)
and of least 2nd-order.
In addition, tool support for foundational work in UTP requires the ability
to easily describe new language constructs,
which can themselves be treated just like predicates,
in keeping with the ``programs are predicates''
philosophy \cite{conf/mlpl/Hoare85} of UTP.


\subsection{Structure}

We next discuss related work (\S\ref{sec:related}) in order to better justify
our decision to ``grow our own'' theorem proving assistant.
We then proceed to look at the logic (\S\ref{sec:logic:foundation},
type-system (\S\ref{sec:types:foundation}),
user defined language support (\S\ref{sec:language:foundation}),
proof procedures (\S\ref{sec:proof:foundation}),
and law matching (\S\ref{sec:match:foundation},
with emphasis on the underlying foundations.
We then discuss useability and experience (\S\ref{sec:usage})
and finally finish with  future work and conclusions (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).
