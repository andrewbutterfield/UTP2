\section{Overview}

The logic of UTP is a variant of the equational logic
espoused by David Gries\cite{gries.93}, with extensions as described below.
In formal terms we take the work of Tourlakis \cite{journals/logcom/Tourlakis01},
and adapt this appropriately.

\section{Syntax}

Particularly in the implementation, we use the terminology
``Expression'' and ``Predicate''
where many logicians use ``Term'' and ``Formula''.
We do not have a clean separation of the two,
as we have expressions that define values with the aid of predicates
(e.g. set comprehensions, and unique values).
Other features to note are the presence of explicit substitutions
in the object language---they are not simply part of the meta-language
defining inference rules---and the use of explicit pattern-matching
meta-variables in quantifier variable lists.

We use the following syntax notation, where
$::=~|~{}^*~{}^+~[~]~(~)~\litm~$ have special meaning:

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
  \hline
  symbol & meaning
\\\hline
  $::=$ & is defined to be
\\
  $|$ & separates alternatives
\\
  $x^*$ & zero or more $x$
\\
  $x^+$ & one or more $x$
\\
  $x^{(*|+)}_s$ & (zero$|$one) or more $x$ separated by $s$
\\
  $[x]$ & optional $x$
\\
  $(\ldots)$ & grouping
\\
  $\litm[$ & the symbol itself
\\\hline
\end{tabular}

Any other character/symbol denotes itself,
and writing $x \in NonT ::= \ldots$ lets $x$ stand for anything that
satisfies the the definition of non-terminal $NonT$
that occurs on the righthand side of the $::=$.

\subsection{Names}


We have a number of variable namespaces (Fig. \ref{fig:UTP2:variables}):
\begin{description}
  \item[Observation Variables]
    correspond to term (or ``ordinary'' variables) in predicate logic,
    and capture observations of the system behaviour being modelled.
  \item[Constants]
    We take all constants (Numeric etc) as ``names'' for their values.
  \item[Function Names]
   are used in applications, as we do not yet support full higher order
   function notation.
  \item[Type Variables]
   are used to support a simple polymorphic type system,
   whose main purpose is to prevent spurious matches.
  \item[Expression Names]
   are names that denote arbitrary expressions
   (known as term ``schematic variables'' in some circles).
  \item[Predicate Names]
   are names that denote arbitrary predicates
   (also known as formula ``schematic variables'').
  \item[Variable-List Names]
   are names that denote a list of variables,
   in contexts where such lists make sense 
   (e.g., quantifier and substitution variable lists).
   These are distinguished from Observation Variables, Expression and Predicate
   Names, is that they have a dollar postfix, e.g, $\lst x, \lst E, \lst P$.
   The only exceptions are the names $OBS$, $MDL$ and $SCR$ which are taken as
   Variable-list variables whose meaning is always a (sorted) list of
   known observation variables (all, model and script respectively).
\end{description}

\begin{figure}
  \framebox{\VARMATHSYNTAX}
  \caption{\UTP2 Variables}
  \label{fig:UTP2:variables}
\end{figure}

The key distinction between observation variables
and metavariables is what they represent:
\begin{description}
  \item[Observations]
     are variables that denote values in some
    kind of semantic domain, with some form of typing used
    to distinguish different parts of that domain.
    The meaning of an expression with free observation variables
    has to be defined w.r.t an environment mapping names to values.
    \begin{eqnarray*}
     \rho \in Env &=& Name \pfun Val
    \end{eqnarray*}
  \item[Metavariables]
     denote expression or formula syntax.
     The meaning of an expression or predicate with free metavariables
     has to be defined w.r.t. an meta-environment (interpretation) mapping names
     to expressions or predicates.
     \begin{eqnarray*}
        \Phi \in EInt &=& Name \pfun Expr \\
     \\ \Psi \in PInt &=& Name \pfun Pred
     \end{eqnarray*}
  \item[List Variables]
    are variables that match lists of variables, where such lists
    make sense.
\end{description}
A key difference between observations $x,y$ and metavariables $X,Y$
is the  outcome of asking for free variables:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  \fv (x \oplus y)&=& \setof{x,y}
\\ \fv (X \bigoplus Y) &=& \fv.X \cup \fv.Y
\end{eqnarray*}
The free variables of a metavariable are dependent on the
the meta-environment (interpretation) in place.
The requirement to handle free-variables in this way leads
to the need to have an explicit notation to describe free-variable sets.

\subsection{Types (Sorts)}

We have the type syntax shown in Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:types}.
\begin{figure}
\boxedm{\TYPEMATHSYNTAX}
  \caption{\UTP2 Type Syntax}
  \label{fig:UTP2:types}
\end{figure}
We do not have naturals or reals as basic types,
although the former will probably be introduced shortly,
to support probabilistic reasoning.
The $Env$ type is a placeholder for name environments,
where the range type is often not expressible using the
above type language, because it is some form of universal type.


\subsection{Expressions (Terms)}

The core expression syntax (Fig. \ref{fig:UTP2:expressions})
has constants, variables
(for both values and expressions),
application of (named) functions%
\footnote{%
We use a definition table to connect function names to abstractions
---we should really do a proper higher-order expression model here,
but it's not a high priority right now.}
,
and abstractions and substitutions over observation, expression and predicate variables.
Also provided are equality, and definite descriptions, which has predicate components (to be defined).
Not shown are the explicit support for binary operators,
or booleans, integers, sets, lists and maps.
\begin{figure}
\framebox{\EXPRMATHSYNTAX}
  \caption{\UTP2 Expression Syntax}
  \label{fig:UTP2:expressions}
\end{figure}
We note here, that unlike terms in \cite{journals/logcom/Tourlakis01},
our expressions here have quantifiers, and may contain predicates
(well-founded formulas) as sub-components.


\subsection{Predicates (Formulas)}

The core logic is higher order,
with quantification, abstraction and substitution for variables, expressions and predicates.
In particular we have predicates that use predicate-sets
(useful for recursion theory, in particular).
\begin{figure}
\framebox{\PREDMATHSYNTAX}
  \caption{\UTP2 Predicates (and Sets)}
  \label{fig:UTP2:predicates}
\end{figure}
We also have a simple polymorphic type-system, and a predicate asserting that
an expression has a specified type---details to be added.
This means that our logic is in fact many-sorted.


\section{Substitution}

The meaning of $A[x:=t]$ in Tourlakis is not given
explicitly, but is discussed, particularly with regard
to the  side-condition designed to avoid variable capture ($t$ substitutable in $x$ (in $A$)).
We shall define $P[x_1,\ldots,x_n:=e_1,\ldots,e_n]$
as meta-notation describing the simultaneous syntactical substitution
of each $e_i$ for all free occurrences of the corresponding $x_i$ in $P$, with $\alpha$-renaming being
used to avoid name-capture. We will write this in shorthand as $[\vec x:=\vec e]$.

So we have explicit substitutions in the object language (written $[e/x]$),
and syntactical-substitutions used to define axiom schemas and inference rules
(written $[x:=e]$).
We use the notation $[\vec x := \vec e]\hide\vec y$
to denote a substitution with all entries $(x_i,e_i)$ removed
where $x_i$ is a member of $\vec y$.
We also have a notion of substitution composition,
denoted by juxtaposition.

There is also another complication,
given that we can abstract over different classes of variables.
Consider the following example (with $X$ used as a predicate meta-variable,
to make it stand out):
$$
  ((\Lambda X @ Q \lor X)R)[e/x]
$$
If we evaluation this by reducing the predicate application first we obtain:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  && ((\Lambda X @ Q \lor X)R)[e/x]
\EQV{Predicate $\beta$-reduction}
\\&& (Q \lor R)[e/x]
\EQV{Defn. of observation substitution}
\\&& Q[e/x] \lor R[e/x]
\end{eqnarray*}
Now let's do the substitution first:
\begin{eqnarray*}
  && ((\Lambda X @ Q \lor X)R)[e/x]
\EQV{Defn.of observation substitution}
\\&& ((\Lambda X @ Q \lor X)[e/x])(R[e/x])
\end{eqnarray*}
The question now concerns how we evaluate
$$
(\Lambda X @ Q \lor X)[e/x].
$$
If we say that the quantifier applies to predicate variables,
but not to observation variables, so it can be ignored,
then we obtain
$$
  \Lambda X @ Q[e/x] \lor X[e/x]
$$
If we do this and then $\beta$-reduce, we obtain
$$
  Q[e/x] \lor (R[e/x])[e/x]
$$
This is not the correct outcome, as substitutions are not idempotent
(consider $e=x+1$ in this example).

So we see that the rule for substitution here is
context dependent --- we cannot apply an observation substitution
to any $\Lambda$-bound predicate (or expression) meta-variable.
This generalises to whenever we substitute for one type
of variable (obs/expr/pred) under a lambda binding a different kind.
If the variables are $\forall$ or $\exists$-bound,
then the substitution is safe.

In Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:obs-expr-Expr-subst}
we show the basic definition of syntactical substitution of expressions
for observations, in expressions,
without details of how variable capture is avoided.
Following figures deal with predicates, and substitution
for predicate and expression meta-variables

\section{Axioms}

We take our inspiration from \cite{journals/logcom/Tourlakis01}:
\begin{quote}
\begin{description}
  \item[Ax1.] All propositional axioms from \cite{gries.93}.
  \item[Ax2.] $A \lor (\forall x @ B) \equiv (\forall x @ A \lor B), x \notin A$
  \item[Ax3.] $(\forall x @ A) \implies A[x:=t]$ ($t$ substitutable in $x$ (in $A$))
  \item[Ax4.] $x = x$
  \item[Ax5. (Liebniz)] $x = t \implies (A \equiv A[x:=t])$
     \\($t$ substitutable in $x$ (in $A$))
\end{description}
\end{quote}
The meaning of $A[x:=t]$ in Tourlakis is not given
explicitly, but is discussed, particularly with regard
to the  side-condition designed to avoid variable capture ($t$ substitutable in $x$ (in $A$)).
We shall define $A[x:=t]$
as meta-notation describing the substitution
of $t$ for all free $x$ in $A$, with $\alpha$-renaming being
used to avoid name-capture (so the side-conditions on Ax3 and 5 above can be dropped).
Our take on the propositional axioms is shown in Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:prop-axioms}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
  \boxedm{$$
  \AXPROP
  $$}
\end{center}
  \caption{\UTP2 Propositional Axioms}
  \label{fig:UTP2:prop-axioms}
\end{figure}
The remaining axioms are shown in Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:non-prop-axioms}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\boxedm{$$
  \AXNONPROP
$$}
\end{center}
  \caption{\UTP2 Non-propositional Axioms}
  \label{fig:UTP2:non-prop-axioms}
\end{figure}
The substitution axioms (\LNAME{Ax-XXX-Subst}) are experimental.
The reflexivity axiom, and that for $\theta$ are in fact schemas, indexed by all possible
types (sorts), as we have a many-sorted logic.

Also worth noting are the $\beta$-reduction axioms, e.g.
$$\AXObetaRed~.$$
The lhs can match a lambda-expression with only one variable ($(\lambda x @ e)f$)
which results in the rhs being $(\lambda \qsep @ e)[f/x]$,
which is just $e[f/x]$.
So, to maintain consistency, we should be able to match a rhs
of the form $e[f/x]$ and then view it as a zero-argument lambda abstraction,
and succeed, returning the lhs as $(\lambda x @ e)f$.




\section{Inference}

From \cite{journals/logcom/Tourlakis01}:
\begin{description}
  \item[Inf1. (Substitution)]  (no capture)
  \item[Inf2. (Leibniz)] $\INFER{A\equiv B}{C[p:=A] \equiv C[p:=B]}$
  \item[Inf3. (Equanimity)] $\INFER{A, A \equiv B}{B}$
  \item[Inf4. (Transitivity)] $\INFER{A\equiv B, B \equiv C}{A \equiv C}$\\
\end{description}
We note that Inf4 is derivable from  Inf2 and Inf3, so we treat it
as derivable.
Our inference rules are shown in Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:inference-rules}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\boxedm{$$
  \INFERENCES
$$}
\end{center}
  \caption{\UTP2 Inference Rules}
  \label{fig:UTP2:inference-rules}
\end{figure}

\section{Proof/Theorems}

We adopt the definitions from \cite{journals/logcom/Tourlakis01}
with minor changes in notation:

The set of $\Gamma$-theorems, $\mathbf{Thm}_\Gamma$,
is the $\subseteq$-smallest subset of $Pred$ that satisfies:
\begin{description}
  \item[Th1]
     $\mathbf{Thm}_\Gamma$ contains as subset the closure under (Substitution)
     of all the propositional axioms (Fig. \ref{fig:UTP2:prop-axioms})
     and all the instances of the axiom schemata for the non-propositional part
     (Fig. \ref{fig:UTP2:non-prop-axioms})---the so-called logical axioms.
  \item[Th2] $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbf{Thm}_\Gamma$---the non-logical axioms.
  \item[Th3] $\mathbf{Thm}_\Gamma$ is closed under (Leibniz) and (Equanimity).
\end{description}
We write $p \in \mathbf{Thm}_\Gamma$ as $\Gamma \vdash p$,
and use $\vdash p$ to denote $\emptyset \vdash p$.

A finite sequence $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ of $Pred$
is a $\Gamma$-proof iff every $p_i$, for $i=1,\ldots,n$
is one of
\begin{description}
  \item[Pr1] A logical axiom
  \item[Pr2] A member of $\Gamma$
  \item[Pr3] The result of either (Leibniz) or (Equanimity)
   applied to some $p_j$, with $j < i$.
\end{description}


\section{Meta-Theorems}

We shall need to identify the derived rules that are embodied,
either in the matcher or in the provided proof strategies,
as these form part of the prover ``core''
(e.g. the deduction theorem and the \texttt{Assume} strategy,
or the all the derived variants of \LNAME{AX-$\lor$-$\forall$-scope},
which are implemented by \texttt{completeMatch}, in module \texttt{Manipulation}).
Some of these rules are presented in Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:derived-rules}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\boxedm{$$
  \DERIVED
$$}
\end{center}
  \caption{\UTP2 Derived Rules}
  \label{fig:UTP2:derived-rules}
\end{figure}
Post's Tautology Theorem
requires more background.
Of considerable importance is the Herbrand Deduction Theorem
and its variants, shown in Figure \ref{fig:UTP2:deduction-theorem}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\boxedm{$$
  \DEDUCTION
$$}
\end{center}
  \caption{\UTP2 Deduction Theorem}
  \label{fig:UTP2:deduction-theorem}
\end{figure}
The Flexible Deduction rule is implemented,
as suggested in \cite{journals/logcom/Tourlakis01},
not by doing the substitution, but by making $\vec x$
behave like constants, by marking them as ``known'',
to use the parlance in module \texttt{Matching}.


\section{Undefinedness}

We have yet to make a firm decision how to handle undefinedness,
apart from noting that the technical details of how this is
done have implications for the validity of the reflexivity of equals,
and of the Deduction Theorem, among others.
