We have defined a sub-class of names as matching observation list-variables,
namely those names with decor that starts with \texttt{chrLIST} (currently
\texttt\$).

We further classify as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[Reserved:]  $O$, $M$, $S$
  \item[Generic:] $\lst v$, $\lst e$, \ldots (lowercase)
\end{description}
