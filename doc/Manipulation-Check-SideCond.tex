\textbf{Check Side-Conditions}\\ % outer list
Given bindings, lists of unmapped meta-variables
and the goal and translated law side-conditions
we want to check that the goal condition implies
the law one, and return the final bindings if this is the case.
However, if any meta variable in the law side-condition
is unmapped by the binding, then we cannot check the side-condition
at this stage and instead will have to do it if this match
is actually chosen to be applied to the goal predicate. Finally, we ignore any freshness conditions as they 
have already been resolved, or will be when the match is actually applied.
