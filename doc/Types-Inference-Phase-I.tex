The first phase involves a recursive descent through an expression,
generating unique type variables, and building up two tables:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $vt : VT = \texttt{Var} \pfun \texttt{Tvar}^+$
   \\ mapping variables to a normalised list of\texttt{Tvar}s,
      all deemed to be the same.
      (Note: we treat \texttt{Evar}s the same as \texttt{Tvar}s for type-checking).
  \item $tt: TT =  \texttt{TVar} \pfun \texttt{Type}^+$
    \\ mapping Tvars to normalised list of types,
     also all deemed to be the same.
\end{itemize}
