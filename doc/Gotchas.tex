\section{Gotchas}

This at the moment is a unstructured list of things we feel you really
ought to know before you start hacking.

\begin{itemize}
  \item
    The datatypes \texttt{Expr} and \texttt{Pred}
    in \texttt{src/Datatypes.lhs} have ``focus'' variants
    used in proofs.
    These no longer use a ``knot-tying'' style (see \texttt{src/Focus.lhs}).
    So this gotcha in earlier versions of this guide
    is no longer an issue.
\end{itemize}
