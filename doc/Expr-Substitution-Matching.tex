We have a pattern, where w.l.o.g., we have the standard variables first
($u_1,\ldots,u_k$) and the list-variables last ($ \lst v_1,\ldots,\lst v_\ell$),
and the expressions substituting for the list-variables are themselves
list variables%
\footnote{We require this restriction for now. We could be more liberal
and allow expressions to substitute for list variables ($\lst v_i$),
but then that list variable must match a single variable.}
 ($\lst f_1,\ldots,\lst f_\ell$):
$$
 [ e_1,\ldots,e_k , \lst f_1,\ldots,\lst f_\ell
 /
   u_1,\ldots,u_k ,  \lst v_1,\ldots,\lst v_\ell ]
 , \quad k+\ell \geq 1
$$
and test:
$$
 [ g_1,\ldots,g_n , \lst h_1,\ldots,\lst h_m
 /
   a_1,\ldots,a_n ,  \lst b_1,\ldots,\lst b_m ]
 , \quad m+n \geq 1
$$
The $e_i$ and $g_i$ are expressions,
while all the others are variables.
Matching must take into account:
\begin{itemize}
  \item First of all, $n \geq k$, or no match is possible.
  \item If $n > k$, or $m > 1$ then we must have $\ell > 1$.
  \item We have already matched matched elsewhere some of the $e_i$ and $u_i$
        against some $k$ of the $g_i$ and $a_i$.
        The resulting bindings are of the form:
        $$
          \begin{array}{ccc}
             e_i & \ddagger & g_i
          \\ u_j & \mapsto & a_j
          \end{array}
        $$
  \item We are then left with pattern:
        $$
        [  \lst f_1,\ldots,\lst f_\ell
        /
           \lst v_1,\ldots,\lst v_\ell ]
        $$
        and test, where w.l.o.g., we assume the first $k$ were matched:
        $$
         [ g_{k+1},\ldots,g_n , \lst h_1,\ldots,\lst h_m
         /
         a_{k+1},\ldots,a_n ,  \lst b_1,\ldots,\lst b_m ]
         , \quad m+n \geq 1
        $$
        If $\ell=0$ and $m+n > 0$ we fail,
        otherwise we simply return additional bindings
        consistent with any side-conditions
        $$
         \begin{array}{l@{\mapsto}l}
            \lst f_i & \seqof{g_j,\lst h_j}
         \\ \lst v_i & \seqof{a_j,\lst b_j}
         \end{array}
        $$
\end{itemize}
The bindings for $e_i$ are normal expression match bindings,
those for $u_i$ are \texttt{Var} expression variant
and for $\lst v_k$ we have standard \texttt{QVar} bindings.
The bindings for the $\lst f$ are in general a pair of lists,
one of expressions, the other of variables.
We store these two lists as  a \texttt{Seq} expression variant
with the variables wrapped up as \texttt{Var}s.

The match  must satisfy
$$
  n \geq k \land ((n \neq k \lor m > 0) \implies \ell > 0)
$$
in order for it to be feasible.
