* Vision
** Threepenny app packagable as a distributable
** Expose Threepenny event data
** Threepenny flexbox library
** Threepenny right-click menu library
** Full Threepenny UTP2 app

   
* TODO Finish home screen
* TODO Navbar
* TODO Fix contextmenu altering source element styling
  Similar behaviour noticed when adding on click handler to materialise styled
  button. Possibly not a fault of contextmenu code.
* DESIGN Write Threepenny Flexbox library
* DESIGN Package as Electron app
  https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui/issues/111
** DONE Electron as main entry point
   CLOSED: [2017-02-28 Tue 15:31]
   We need to start the Threepenny server as a child process from Electron
   instead of starting the Electron app from Haskell. Edited the ~electron.js~
   to do this, also selects a random free port in the ~15000 range and waits for
   the Threepenny server to have started before displaying.
** Use electron-builder to create distributable
** Write instructions
* IMPLEMENT Expose Threepenny event data
  https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui/issues/167
* DONE Demonstrate file selection
 CLOSED: [2017-02-23 Thu 14:55]
 File selection prints the full filepath to std out on value change.
* DONE Instructions to run app-threepenny
 CLOSED: [2017-02-23 Thu 15:25]
 Instructions include installing Electron.
* DONE Install Electron as local dependency
 CLOSED: [2017-02-23 Thu 18:28]
 Requires running the app from the root directory.
* DONE Execute given actions on file selection
 CLOSED: [2017-02-23 Thu 18:54]
 The function which creates a file selection element should take an additional
 argument of UI actions to run on file input value change.
* DONE Add threepenny-gui-contextmenu
 CLOSED: [2017-02-23 Thu 20:15]
* DONE Fix contextmenu positioning
 CLOSED: [2017-02-24 Fri 16:27]
 This required changing the coordinates reported by Threepenny's JavaScript,
 switched to using a fork of Threepenny at
 https://github.com/barischj/threepeny-gui
* DONE Add unique ID generator to UTP2 monad
 CLOSED: [2017-02-24 Fri 17:01]
 Added MVar to UTP2 monad config which holds current ID integer.
 incremented on each unique ID access.
