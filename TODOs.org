* TODO File selector takes emitter as a parameter
* DESIGN Safe JS execution
  This means returning a ~Maybe~ from an ~ffi~ call incase execution failed,
  where failure is either a ~null~ or ~undefined~.
* IMPLEMENT FRP for display workspace
* TODO Select directory
* TODO Finish home screen
* DESIGN Navbar
* TODO Fix contextmenu altering source element styling

  Similar behaviour noticed when adding on click handler to materialise styled
  button. Possibly not a fault of contextmenu code.
* VERIFY Package as Electron app
  https://github.com/HeinrichApfelmus/threepenny-gui/issues/111
** DONE Electron as main entry point
   CLOSED: [2017-02-28 Tue 15:31]
   We need to start the Threepenny server as a child process from Electron
   instead of starting the Electron app from Haskell. Edited the ~electron.js~
   to do this, also selects a random free port in the ~15000 range and waits for
   the Threepenny server to have started before displaying.
** Use electron-builder to create distributable
** Write instructions
* IMPLEMENT Expose Threepenny event data
