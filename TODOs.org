** DONE Electron as main entry point
   CLOSED: [2017-02-28 Tue 15:31]
   We need to start the Threepenny server as a child process from Electron
   instead of starting the Electron app from Haskell. Edited the ~electron.js~
   to do this, also selects a random free port in the ~15000 range and waits for
   the Threepenny server to have started before displaying.
