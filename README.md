# Unifying Theories of Programming Theorem Prover 

## U(TP)2

This is an application written using literate Haskell.
This means that the Haskell source files have extension `.lhs`
and are LaTeX sources with Haskell embedded in 
`\begin{code}..\end{code}` environments.

The main file for the application program is `src/UTP2.lhs`

The main file for the enclosing LaTeX documentation is `UTP2-MAIN.tex`

A Hackers Guide is being prepared in `UTP2-Hacking-MAIN.tex`
